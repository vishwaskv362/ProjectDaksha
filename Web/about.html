          Daksha is an <span>automated attendance system</span> developed by the students of Global Acadamy of technology fo the purpose of automating the complete process of taking attendance after the class is over. Having a database that manages all the data would be more helpful and more accurate.
          <br>
          <br>
          There is one more reason for us to be doing this. In some cases the students tend to mark false attendance and this is a very wrong practice that this system very specifically tries to eliminate.
          <br><br>
          On a whole the key intent of the system mainly aims to simplify the process of taking attendance for the teachers and manage all the data in a single database. Despite the fact that there are definately certain drawbacks and vulnerabilities to the face identifaction, we find no other approch that could solve the process with maximum time management. The key tech stack of this system includes python, opencv, android studio, fire base, html, css and Javascript.
