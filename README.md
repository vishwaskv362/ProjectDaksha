# ProjectDaksha
The process of taking attendance in a classroom is a tedious, time consuming and boring task, at end
of each hour. To make the process smoother and more legitimate, to avoid the concept of false
attendance or miss mark, we aim to automate the process throughout. In addition, we should be able
to add new students or delete students considering the situation.
The main question still is why do we need to do this? The answer is we see that in many cases
students try to mark false attendance for their fellow mates while they are actually not present in the
classroom. The second most intuitive aspect is that we are trying to make the process simpler for the
teachers and more precisely that was the key motive for us to take up this project.
Another very important thing that comes into the project summery is that how do we plan to that. We
place the camera at the front of the class door, watch over every student entering the class and leave
the class and the time is noted during the process. This noted time will be the deciding factor for us to
mark the attendance for the student. If the student is in the class on time or with a allowance of 10
minutes of extra time, we consider the attendance for the student for that specific day. Based on this
report the teachers/Lecturers (or any stakeholder responsible for the attendance record) will be able to
update their records. On the other side, this will reduce (not nullify) the chances of marking false
attendance.
Despite the fact that there are a lot of vulnerabilities and constraints in using face identification, we
find no other approach to this statement. An other classic approach to automated attendance system
can be the use of bio-metrics, but the management of out time can prove to be a rather difficult task as
a student can mark attendance and leave the room. So we consider the approach of Face Identification
the most suitable and by far on of recommended way of automating the attendance system.
Daksha is an automated attendance system developed by the students of Global Acadamy of technology fo the 
purpose of automating the complete process of taking attendance after the class is over. Having a database that manages all the data would be more helpful and more accurate.
There is one more reason for us to be doing this. In some cases the students tend to mark false attendance and this is a very wrong practice that this system very specifically 
tries to eliminate. On a whole the key intent of the system mainly aims to simplify the process of taking attendance for the teachers and manage all the data in a single database. 
Despite the fact that there are definately certain drawbacks and vulnerabilities to the face identifaction, we find no other approch that could solve the process with maximum time management. 
The key tech stack of this system includes python, opencv, android studio, fire base, html, css and Javascript.
